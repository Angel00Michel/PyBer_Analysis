# Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to represent the 'ride-sharing data' by each given city type, and to articulate a graph that demonstrates the total weekly fares for each given city type.

# Results
The accurate results below describes an overview of the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride/driver, total fare by city type between the months of January to April 2019.

The table above describes that Urban areas representing the majority of total rides (roughly 69%), and drivers (about 80%), while Suburban, and especially Rural areas have a much smaller average of total rides (about 26% Suburban and about Rural 5%), and drivers averaged about 17% and 3%; respectively.

The average fare per ride, however, is much larger as you go from Urban ($24.5) to Rural ($34.6). This is even more pronounced with the average Fare per driver going from $16.60 in Urban areas to $55.48 in Rural areas.

Based on the graph below, Urban cities still make the biggest contribution of fare per month even if the average fare is lower than the Rural cities. This is due to the large amount of riders in the Urban areas.

# Summary
1. Recommendations to the CEO for addressing any discrepencies among the city types. 
2. Try to increase the amount of drivers in rural and suburban areas, if possible. That might lower the disproportianate scales between city types. This can be done by potentially changing the way we charge the customers in Urban areas (maybe as a function of time) since the fare per driver is low compared to other city types.
3. Adjust the number of drivers in city type based on the demand in that area (for specific month).
